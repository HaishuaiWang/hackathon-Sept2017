Contestants are challenged with providing a user interface data exploration tool fed by PIC-SURE queries. Any data manipulations must be performed either inside the web browser or through the new PIC-SURE Scripted Query functionality (JS and possibly Python or R). Each team should contain at least one scientist (PostDoc, PhD student, etc.) and at least two developers.
